# run
(1)If you want to use CPPLS to build a cell-to-cell communication network, you can decompress the 2023_01_seqFISH+.zip and 2023_01_Seq-Scope.zip packages and run them in Rï¼š

run 2023_01_seqFISH+.RMD

run 2023_01_Seq-Scope.RMD

(2)After building a communication network between two cells, we have integrated the cell communication network into a MIMO system. If you want to get this result, you need to unzip the compare_hvg.zip, which contains the solution for all paths for each cell, and get the MIMO system in a code file called a directed graph.
